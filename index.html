        <li>Research, Data Analysis and Writing</li>
        <p> I have a vast experience in conducting research using empirical methods through my 
          econometric classes at Middlebury College. I have since become profecient in data analysis 
          using Stata and R. I have also honed my writing skills through writing papers 
          for the various research projects I conducted.

        <li>Programming</li>
        <p>I have vast programming experience through my summer internship and various projects through Computer Science classes.
          I am proficient in Java, C, C++, Python and Javascript. I have experience using React, Nodejs, and Django for web development.
          I am moslty interested in system programs because of my interest in Unix systems.

                        <p>In this project I worked with another student to write progrmas in C and C++ that 
                          ran in microcontrollers to analysize data collected by sensors of the robotic car and
                          issue an appopriate command to the actuators to get the desired movement. 
                          The robotic car can be remotely controlled using a mobilephone app via blutooth.

                        <p>I have written hundreds of lines of C code for Arch Linux and FreeBSD systems. Some of the 
                          programs I made include ls, malloc, the shell, a linker and a collection of system call wrappers such as 
                          lseek, read and close. I also made a webserver than can allow clients to connect and communicate. For FreeBSD,
                          I made an program that can traverse a raw disk image of a fast filesystem and print any content in it. </p>

                        <p>I used Java to impliment several projects using the 
                          fundementals of AI I learned in class. Some of the projects include 
                          sodoku solver using constraint propagation, a binary decision tree classifier 
                          and a sentiment analysis program using Na√Øve Bayes. For my final project, I worked 
                          with two other students to conduct research on random forests algorithm and implimented
                          one from scratch to boost the performance of the decision tree classifier.

                          7 students where we created OneList using agile methods of developement. 
                          We used the React framework and Nodejs to create a serverless application 
                          that would allow people to create a playlist that their friends could contribute
                         to regardless of whether they had Spotify or not. Users could also upvote or 
                        downvote songs to to play songs they liked more, and less of songs they did not like.</p>
