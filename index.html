  <p>In my Software Development Class I worked in a team with other

     We used the React framweork and Nodejs to create a serverless application 
    that would allow people to create a playlist that their friend could contribute
  to regardless of whether they had Spotify or not. Users could also upvote or 
  downvote songs to to play songs they liked more, and less of songs they did not like.</p>
