                        <p>In this project I worked with another student to write progrmas in C and C++ that 
                          ran in microcontrollers to analysize data collected by sensors of the 
                          <a href=" https://chekomkocheko.github.io/roboticrover/"> robotic car</a> and
                          issue an appopriate command to the actuators to get the desired movement. 
                          The robotic car can be remotely controlled using a mobilephone app via blutooth.

                        <p>I have written hundreds of lines of C code for Arch Linux and FreeBSD systems. Some of the 
                          programs I made include <a href="https://chekomkocheko.github.io/os-project-1/">ls</a>,
                          <a href="https://chekomkocheko.github.io/os-project-3/">malloc</a>, 
                          <a href="https://chekomkocheko.github.io/os-project-5/">the shell</a>, 
                          <a href="https://chekomkocheko.github.io/os-project-4/">a linker</a>, and a
                          <a href="https://chekomkocheko.github.io/os-project-2/">collection of system call wrappers</a>
                          such as lseek, read and close. I also made a <a href="https://chekomkocheko.github.io/os-project-7/">webserver</a>
                          that can allow clients to connect and communicate. For FreeBSD,
                          I made an program that can traverse a raw disk image of a fast filesystem and print any content in it. </p>

                        <p>I used Java to impliment several projects using the 
                          fundementals of AI I learned in class. Some of the projects include 
                          <a href="https://chekomkocheko.github.io/ai-project-2/">sodoku solver</a>
                          using constraint propagation, <a href="https://chekomkocheko.github.io/ai-project-3/">a binary decision tree classifier </a>
                          and <a href="https://chekomkocheko.github.io/ai-project-2/">a sentiment analysis program</a> 
                          using Na√Øve Bayes. For my final project, I worked with two other students to conduct research 
                          on random forests algorithm and <a href="http://akliesen.middcreate.net/introduction/">implimented one from scratch</a> 
                          to boost the performance of the decision tree classifier.

                          7 students where we created <a href="https://one-list.azurewebsites.net/">OneList</a> using agile methods of developement. 
                          We used the React framework and Nodejs to create a serverless application 
                          that would allow people to create a playlist that their friends could contribute
                         to regardless of whether they had Spotify or not. Users could also upvote or 
                        downvote songs to to play songs they liked more, and less of songs they did not like.</p>
