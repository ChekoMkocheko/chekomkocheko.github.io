          <p>Brief description of Project 1</p>
          <h3>Project 2: Operating Systems Projects</h3>
          <p>I have written hundreds of lines of C code for Arch Linux and FreeBSD 
            applications such as ls, malloc and the shell. 
            I have also written servers and a program that explores 
            the contents of a raw disk image for a fast file system</p>
          <h3>Project 3: Ai Projects</h3>
          <p>I used Java to impliment several projects using the 
            fundementals of AI I learned in class. Some of the projects include 
            Sodoku Solver using constraint propagation, a decision tree classifier and 
          Sentiment Analysis Program using bayes probability. 
          I also did a final project on Random Forest based on decision trees 
        for better classification </p>
          <h3>Project 4: WebApps</h3>
          <p>In my Software Development Class I worked in a team with other
            7 students where we created OneList using agile methods of developement. 
            We used the React framweork and Nodejs to create a serverless application 
            that would allow people to create a playlist that their friend could contribute
          to regardless of whether they had Spotify or not. Users could also upvote or 
          downvote songs to to play songs they liked more, and less of songs they did not like.</p>
